- [ ] move commented out search bar to the navbar
- [ ] refactor error handling and create custom component for ui-core
- [ ] implement unit tests
- [ ] implement cd/ci using github actions and Heroku
- [ ] implement storybook
- [ ] setup other client-side routes (ie. nations, characters, etc.)
- [ ] refactor avatars route and components (build out ui-core)
- [ ] dashboard of statistics for various stats (ie. # of characters, broken down by nation, etc.)
- visual of the ATLA worldmap
- [ ] add backend Node.js server and refactor to be monolith or microservice (if microservice, dockerize containers for frontend and backend)
