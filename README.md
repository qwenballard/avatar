- [ ] refactor error handling and create custom component for ui-core
- [ ] implement unit tests
- [ ] implement storybook
- [ ] setup other client-side routes (ie. nations, characters, etc.)
- [ ] refactor avatars route and components (build out ui-core)
- [ ] add backend Node.js server and refactor to be monolith or microservice (if microservice, dockerize containers for frontend and backend)
